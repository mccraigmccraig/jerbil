= Jerbil -- Java build system based on Rake[http://rake.rubyforge.org] and RJB

  "If I knew then what I know now, I would have tried using a real
  scripting language, such as JavaScript via the Rhino component or
  Python via JPython, with bindings to Java objects which implemented
  the functionality expressed in todays tasks. Then, there would be a
  first class way to express logic and we wouldn't be stuck with XML as
  a format that is too bulky for the way that people really want to use
  the tool."
  
    -- James Duncan Davidson, creator of ant
 
This package contains several TaskLibs for Rake which can be
used to build Java projects. Jerbil uses RJB[http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/rjb/]
(Ruby-Java-Bridge) to load a Java virtual machine in the ruby process running rake.

The jvm is then used to compile Java source files, create javadocs etc.
It is not a complete replacement for ant (yet), but has some significant advantages as it
is easily scriptable. The main focus at the moment are small to medium-sized projects using 
testng[http://testng.org] and hibernate[http://hibernate.org].

== Requirements

Jerbil requires rjb and JDK 1.5. The JAVA_HOME environment variable needs to point to the
installed JDK.

== Installation

  % gem install jerbil --source http://code.trampolinesystems.com

Jerbil might become an 'official' rubygem at some later point. Some tasks require additional
jar files, for example Jerbil::TestNG::TestNGTask.

The source code is available via anon svn: http://svn.trampolinesystems.com/jerbil/
  
== Example

See the example/ subdirectory in the repository.

  % svn co http://svn.trampolinesystems.com/jerbil/trunk/example

== Advantages over ant

Well, it's based on Ruby :) Additionally, RJB allows ruby classes to implement
