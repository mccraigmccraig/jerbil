= Jerbil -- Java build system based on Rake[http://rake.rubyforge.org] and RJB

  "If I knew then what I know now, I would have tried using a real
  scripting language, such as JavaScript via the Rhino component or
  Python via JPython, with bindings to Java objects which implemented
  the functionality expressed in todays tasks. Then, there would be a
  first class way to express logic and we wouldn't be stuck with XML as
  a format that is too bulky for the way that people really want to use
  the tool."
  
    -- James Duncan Davidson, creator of Apache Ant
 
This package contains several TaskLibs for Rake which can be
used to build Java projects. 

Jerbil uses RJB[http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/rjb/]
(Ruby-Java-Bridge) to load a Java virtual machine into Rake.

The jvm is then used to compile Java source files, create javadocs etc.
It is not a complete replacement for ant (yet), but has several advantages such as
extremly compact build files and easy scriptability. 

The main focus at the moment are small to medium-sized projects using 
testng[http://testng.org] and hibernate[http://hibernate.org].

== Requirements

Jerbil requires rubygems[http://rubygems.org], Rake, RJB and JDK 1.5. 

== Installation

You need to have rubygems installed. On Debian systems (testing) this is a simple as
  
  % apt-get install rubygems
  
Rake and rjb are best installed using gem:

  % gem install rake
  % gem install rjb
  
The installation of rjb requires that the JDK is installed and JAVA_HOME set up
accordingly. Finally jerbil needs to be installed:

  % gem install jerbil --source http://code.trampolinesystems.com

Jerbil might become an 'official' rubygem at some later point. Note that some tasks require additional
jar files, for example Jerbil::TestNG::TestNGTask.

The source code is available via subversion: http://svn.trampolinesystems.com/jerbil/
  
== Example

See the example/[http://svn.trampolinesystems.com/jerbil/trunk/example] subdirectory in the repository.

  % svn co http://svn.trampolinesystems.com/jerbil/trunk/example

== Advantages over Ant

Well, it's based on Ruby :) Additionally, RJB allows Ruby code to implement arbitary
Java interfaces which you can then pass into compiled Java code.  
See Jerbil::TestNG::TestListener for an example.

* Raven[http://raven.rubyforge.org/]: similar to jerbil in scope, but different approach (invokes 
  javac directly, no Java-Ruby integration).
